# Python Libraries 
Many popular Python toolboxes/libraries:
• NumPy
• SciPy
• Pandas
• SciKit-Lear

NumPy:
1. introduces objects for multidimensional arrays and matrices, as well as
functions that allow to easily perform advanced mathematical and statistical
operations on those objects
2. provides vectorization of mathematical operations on arrays and matrices
which significantly improves the performance

3.many other python libraries are built on NumPy


 Pandas:
1. adds data structures and tools designed to work with table-like data (similar
to Series and Data Frames in R)
2. provides tools for data manipulation: reshaping, merging, sorting, slicing,
aggregation etc.
3. allows handling missing data
